	// MXAuthPolicy is an object that provides security check for outbound connections.

	//
	// - Check effective TLS level or MX level against some configured or
	// discovered value.
	// E.g. local policy.
	//
	// - Raise the security level if certain condition about used MX or
	// connection is met.
	// E.g. DANE MXAuthPolicy raises TLS level to Authenticated if a matching
	// TLSA record is discovered.
	//
	// - Reject the connection if certain condition about used MX or
	// connection is _not_ met.
	// E.g. An enforced MTA-STS MXAuthPolicy rejects MX records not matching it.
