	// done by caller code. Its implementation responsibility to do so if it is
	// necessary. It is not recommended to reject duplicated recipients,
	// however. They should be silently ignored.
	//
	// Implementation should do as much checks as possible here and reject
	// recipients that can't be used.  Note: MsgMetadata object passed to StartDelivery
	// contains BodyLength field. If it is non-zero, it can be used to check
	// storage quota for the user before Body.

	// Body sets the body and header contents for the message.
	// If this method fails, message is assumed to be undeliverable

	//
	// Implementation should avoid doing any persistent changes to the
	// underlying storage until Commit is called. If that is not possible,
	// Abort should (attempt to) rollback any such changes.
	//
	// If Body can't be implemented without per-recipient failures,
	// then delivery object should also implement PartialDelivery interface
	// for use by message sources that are able to make sense of per-recipient
	// errors.
	//
	// Here is the example of possible implementation for maildir-based
	// storage:
	// Calling Body creates a file in tmp/ directory.
	// Commit moves the created file to new/ directory.
	// Abort removes the created file.
	Body(ctx context.Context, header textproto.Header, body buffer.Buffer) error

	// Abort cancels message delivery.
	//
	// All changes made to the underlying storage should be aborted at this
	// point, if possible.
	Abort(ctx context.Context) error

	// Commit completes message delivery.
	//
	// It generally should never fail, since failures here jeopardize
	// atomicity of the delivery if multiple targets are used.
